                            <p class="f_400">Our spelling contest is an indoor game that plays on sound and sense, the pronunciation and the meaning of words. The game master known as the Bee Master pronounces a word and states a brief meaning of the word while you as a contestant listen and spell the word in the presence of a panel of judges and a large audience. The challenge is to display your word power and extensive vocabulary simply by spelling your way through both simple and difficult words up to the Grand Finale to win our star prize and become our Bee Champion! </p>

            <div class="">
                The Metro Bee Word List is a spelling study material that contains ten thousand (10,000) words in two volumes.
                <br/>Vol. 1 contains six thousand (6000) words which advanced students are likely to encounter or are likely to have encountered in the course of their higher studies. All the words to be spelt at the prelims and the regionals will be taken from Vol. 1.
                <br/><br/>Vol. 2 contains 4000 English words, which we categorize as difficult owing to their spellings, pronunciations and low frequency of usage. Also many of them have origins in other foreign languages such as French, German and Latin. All the words to be spelt at the Finals will be taken from both volumes 1 and 2, which together make 10,000 words.

                The Bee Champion or winner may emerge in any of the rounds from the 1st to the 3rd. This can happen if only one of the spellers spells his choice word correctly in addition to the next word that has not been spelt in the Bee Master's list. 
                <br/>If there is no winner after the 3rd round, the judges shall call for a tiebreaker of seven words to be served to all the finalists in this round to spell in writing. The speller with the highest score out of seven shall be declared the winner, the Metro Bee Champion 2020.

            <p class="text-center wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.3s">
               Every contestant is allowed 15 seconds to give the correct spelling of a word to be pronounced by the Bee Master. Once the Bee Master pronounces the word, after stating its meaning and its origin, spelling time starts counting down. The contestant may request the pronouncer to repeat the pronunciation of the word, repeat its meaning or its origin. During this time, spelling time keeps counting down.
               If the pronouncer obliges with permission from the judges, time allowed continues to count down.

While the the Word List of ten thousand words   and Cambridge English Pronouncing Dictionary by Daniel Jones are the primary sources of the words in this list, Merriam-Webster Unabridged dictionary is the final authority and ultimate source of words. This Bee Master's List is available only to the Bee Master, and it is issued to the spellers only at the end of bee. Only the Bee Master has prior knowledge of the words in the list before the time of the finals. </p>

The judges monitor the event procedures to ensure the rules are not violated. They listen carefully to both the Bee Master and the spellers and determine whether a word has been correctly pronounced and spelt or not. In any case of misunderstanding by a contestant, they alone determine whether the pronouncer has given sufficient information on the word or not. The judges' decisions are final. </p>
